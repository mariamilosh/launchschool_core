def my_method(a, b = 2, c = 3, d)
  p [a, b, c, d]
end

my_method(4, 5, 6)


Prints an array with a = 4, b = 5, c = 3, d = 6
[4, 5, 3, 6]
b and c are default arguments so they are assigned last. a is assigned the first
argument (4), d is assigned the last argument (6), b is assigned the second
argument (5) and there is none left over so c defaults to (3).
